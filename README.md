# Harrison Cuts

This project is designed as a service website for an imaginary barber shop, *Harrison Cuts*, to showcase my ability to use HTML and CSS for my Milestone One Project for Code Institute.

## Project

The project was made to demonstrate the knowledge I've acquired throughout the Code Institute Full Stack Developer course thus far. With the goal of making a clean and visually appealing website using nothing but HTML and CSS.  

This project is a seven page service website that I am using to display my skills and knowledge when it comes to front end development. The seven pages and their purpose are as follow:

1. **Home:** Landing page meant to grab the users attention and introduce the type of service one would expect.
2. **Book:** The booking page is one big form made out of four different tabs with the sole goal of making an online appointment with the establishment.
3. **Service:** Showcases all the different services the user can buy from the establishment.
4. **About Us:** A bit of info about the establishment as well as a Google map as where to find them.
5. **Customer Support:** Used for the user to send in a support ticket form if they've got a complaint with either the website or an employee.
6. **Contact Us:** A form to contact the establishment regarding a matter.
7. **Join Us:** Page asking a potential employee to fill in the form in order to apply.

## UX

This website highlights the services of Harrison Cuts. Showcasing the type of service, each individual option with not only a brief description of the option but also the price and time required to complete, along with ways to contact the establishment for any reason, and an address where the user can come in person. And, most importantly, the user is able to book an appointment online by filling in the required form.

### User Stories

- The user is able to book an appointment online.
- The user is able to browse the different options from the establishment.
- The user is able to get into contact with the establishment with clear and upfront contact information.
- The user is able to apply for a position with the establishment.

### Wireframes

A link that takes you to the wireframes I made for this project. Note, that the links take you to a PDF file and do not display an image.

![Mobile wireframes](designDocs/wireframes/barbershopMobile.pdf)

Upon a peek, you can see that there were changes made for the final version; some due to restrictions, others due to subjective taste.

## Features

1. Responsive navigation bar.
2. A submit form ranging over four different tabs which consists:
    - A checkbox group,
    - Radio buttons,
    - And two more forms.
3. Form validation
4. A Google Maps embedded into the site.

## Technologies

For this project I used a number of technologies to help me finish.

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap
- Github
- Github pages
- VsCode
- Balsamiq

## Testing

### HTML Validator

The result of the HTML Validator can be seen in the image below:

### CSS Validator

The CSS Validator comes back with errors, but on closer inspection it is clear that all the CSS errors come from the Bootstrap framework, as highlighted in the image below:

### Browsers

The website was tested on these browsers:

1. Chrome
2. Firefox
3. Internet Explorer
4. Edge
5. Opera

The site works as intended for Chrome and Firefox. 

But the IE, Edge, and Opera versions have issues. On Edge the buttons aren't aligned in their proper places, while on IE in addition to the out of lign button, the jumbotron is completely resized as to where it's height is too high and it's width is too small, along with that all the SVGs are either cropped, or moved the left with the photos as well. On Opera the tabs are a bit squished together.

## Deployment

The deployment of the project was done entirely with **GitHub Pages**.

The published source code can be found in [**this repository**](https://github.com/Zylashro/barbershop).

And the finished, live website can be found [**here**](https://zylashro.github.io/barbershop/).

## Self-Reflection

Looking back at this project, I am filled with both delight and a tinge of regret.

For this project I wanted to create a website that would utilize multiple facets of front end development, not including JS. And with that I came to this idea which does consists of different parts. The only issue with it is that this project is better suited for the Milestone Two project in the Code Institute educational curriculum.

I'll be honest, I was a bit stuck on just what kind of project I could make for a static HTML and CSS website. A portfolio website wasn't something I was interested in doing, and with time running out I threw together this, not to say I didn't put in time into planning, but you get the picture. 

As mentioned, the goal of the project is a static website and the one I came up with required user interactivity, which is the main reason Bootstrap was utilized in the creation of this project; to give me some basic JS. But, sadly, Bootstrap just didn't have the JS power I required and this forced me to make a lot of changes to my initial [**wireframes**](#wireframes). In the end, it seems like this idea was a bit too over my head at the moment.

But, not all is doom and gloom. Even if I wasn't able to create the site that I wanted, and was forced to make changes, the learning experience that I acquired was well worth the frustration. Without proper JS, I had to go and find/think about out-of-the-box solutions to my needs where I could. And I learned a very valuable lesson about better analyzing the tech at my disposal before running into a project.
